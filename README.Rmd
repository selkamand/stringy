stringy makes it easy to transform strings / character vectors in oddly specific ways. Common problems stringy solves include:

* Converting variable names to versions that look good as plot axis labels ('camelCase_plus_snake_case' => 'Camel Case Plus Snake Case')

## Installation

You can install the development version of stringy from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("selkamand/stringy")
```

## Quick Start

```{r example}
library(stringy)

prettytext(string = "reallyUglyPoorly_formattedString(not_really_though)")
prettytext(string = "reallyUglyPoorly_formattedString(not_really_though)", capitalisation = "first")
```
